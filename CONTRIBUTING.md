## Summary

This pull request proposes several improvements to the **Contributing Guidelines** to make them more comprehensive, readable, and user-friendly for new and existing contributors. The goal is to streamline the onboarding process, provide better clarity around expectations, and help maintainers receive high-quality issues and pull requests.

## What Was Changed

### ‚úçÔ∏è Content & Structure Improvements
- Refactored the overall structure of the document for better readability and logical flow.
- Clearly separated sections such as **Reporting Issues**, **Submitting Pull Requests**, **Development Setup**, and **Finding Contributions**.
- Grouped related points together under more intuitive headings and subheadings.
- Removed redundant phrases and simplified complex or wordy instructions.

### üîç Clarity & Guidance Enhancements
- Expanded the **Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests** section with more practical examples and detailed instructions for providing reproducible steps, version info, and relevant context.
- Enhanced the **Pull Request Process** to include a clearer workflow for forking, branching, testing, and committing.
- Included commit message guidelines to help contributors write clear, atomic, and well-structured commits.
- Encouraged the use of issue references (`Fixes #123`) for better issue-tracking and project management.

### üìò Additional Resources
- Added helpful links to GitHub documentation for contributors unfamiliar with forking, creating PRs, or checking CI results.
- Linked to related files (e.g., Code of Conduct, Developer Setup Guide, License) more prominently to ensure visibility.

## Why This Change Is Important

As an open-source project, we rely on contributions from a diverse and global community. Having well-written contributing guidelines:
- Reduces back-and-forth between contributors and maintainers.
- Minimizes low-quality PRs or incomplete issues.
- Helps first-time contributors feel confident and supported when navigating the contribution process.
- Aligns the contribution process with industry best practices and the expectations outlined by GitHub and CNCF.

By improving this documentation, we make it easier for contributors to engage effectively, which in turn helps the project scale and improve faster.

## Next Steps

Please review the changes and feel free to suggest any further improvements or sections you'd like expanded. I‚Äôm happy to revise based on feedback from maintainers or the broader community.

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute and for maintaining this awesome project!
